<p>The user has two options to input the structure of the molecule.<br>
    a) Draw it with the plugin from PubChem . While drawing,
    the plugin will generate a SMILES code for your structure. Once finished, just paste the SMILES code to the
    frame on the right. <br>
    b) Upload your own coordinates for the interested structure. Structures in xyz, pdb, sdf, and mol2 are supported.
