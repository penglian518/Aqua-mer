<p><p>The user has two options to input the structure of the molecule,</p>
    <b>a)</b> Draw it with the plugin from PubChem. While drawing,
    the plugin will generate a SMILES code for your structure. Once finished, just <b>paste the SMILES code</b> to the
    frame on the right. Remember to <b>draw the point charge(s) explicitly</b>, if your compound is cation/anion/zwitterion!) <br>
    <b>b)</b> Upload your own coordinates for the structure. Structures in xyz, pdb, sdf, and mol2 are supported.<br><br>
    <b>NOTE:</b> The SMILES code is a simplified version of chemical notation, and it does not handle proton well.
    If protons are important in your structure, you'd better upload your own coordinates in xyz format.
