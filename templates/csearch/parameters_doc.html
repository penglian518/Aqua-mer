<div id="title">Step 2. Searching Parameters</div>
<div id=main>This step provides three algorithms to perform conformation search.
    Each algorithm requires different parameters. You will be asked to provide them accordingly.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>1) Random search.</b> Generate N conformations by randomly rotating the single bonds and than minimize. <br><br>
    <b>2) Replica exchange.</b> Perform an MD simulation with replica exchange technique to search the conformations
    in gas phase, implicit solvent and explicit solvent models. <br><br>
    <b>3) Random DFT.</b> Similar to 1) method but will minimize with DFT methods. Suitable for compound with metal atoms <br><br>
